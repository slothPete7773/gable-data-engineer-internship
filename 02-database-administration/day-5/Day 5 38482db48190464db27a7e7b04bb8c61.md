# Day 5

# What I have learned today

- install SQL Sequal Server
    - and install SSMS
- recap database engine components
- Try a couple of user management in SSMS
    - allow user to access db with `Databases.Security.Logins.{users}` then in the User Mapping tab
    - Add a user to allow new user access by right click at `Security.Logins` and choose `New User`
    - Delete user similar to the process above
- Got a glimpse of the Database backup, but I wasn’t paying attention, sleepiness took me over.
