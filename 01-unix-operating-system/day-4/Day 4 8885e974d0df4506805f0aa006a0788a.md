# Day 4

# What I have learned today

- More on user and group management, specifically changing group and mode.
- Simple encryption and decryption using `gpg`.
- Transfer file and remote transfer with `scp` and `sftp`
- Monitor resource and performance
- Additionally, a little Windows network config for tomorrow Oracle session
  - attempted to check and configure from DHCP to manual

# OS

## User Management cont

```bash
# change owner
$ chown {source}:{dest} {file}
# Change group
$ chgrp {dest-group} {file}
```

## Encryption with GPG

```bash
# Encrypt a file
# Option:
	# c : Symmetric encryption
$ gpg -c {file}

# Decrpyt a file
# Option:
	# d : decrypt
$ gpg -d {file}
```

## Transfer file with SCP

```bash
# Transfer a file, strictly a file, not a directory
$ scp {file} {user}@{address}:/{path/path/}
```

## Transfer and remote with SFTP

```bash
# connet to a remote device
$ sftp {user}@{address}:/{path}

# list files in local machine
$ lls

# list files in remote machine
$ ls

# Download file to remote from local
$ get {file}

# Upload file from local to remote
$ put {file}

# Exit SFTP
$ exit
```

## Adv system management

```bash
# Managing process
## Monitor all process that runs on the system
$ ps -ef
## Kill a process
$ kill
## Real-time system monitor
$ top

# Manage and view system resource
$ free -m
$ iostat
$ df -k
$ sar {1} {5}

# Manage system performance
$ vmstat
$ sysstat
$ iotop

```

# Window Network Setting

This sort of thing
