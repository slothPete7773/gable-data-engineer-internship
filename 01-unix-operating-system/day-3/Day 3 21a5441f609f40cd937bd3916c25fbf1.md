# Day 3

# What I have learned today. (backfilled)

- And mounted and unmounted the DVD/ROM device in the Linux via VM.
- Tried adding a new repo for the package manager.
- Know the command to view all existing services; `systemctl list-unit-files`, both disabled and enabled
  - can enable and disable by `systemctl enable {servicename}.service` and same for disable.
- monitored the Unix performance with `top, sar, mpstat`
- and how to backup and compress the files.
  - using `tar` for both operation
- file transfer command with `rsync`, which I was told that it is not very common, (is it?)
- Copy and convert the disk and partition with Copy and Convert, `dd`, and not cc
- Final lesson was about managing and inspecting the disk space, by inspecting the Physical Volume, Volume Group, and Logical Volume.
  - And how to extend the volume. This process is very rarely to occur in real-life because the very cautious plan must be performed to identify the disk space.

# OS (cont)

Disk space view

```bash
# View the simple disk space usage
df -h
```

Mounting

```bash
# Mounting(Installing) a device to a directory
# Options
	# t : file type
	# o : mounting options -> "ro" in this case stands for read-only mount
	# source : the
	# des
$ mount -t iso9660 -o ro {/dev/cdrom}(source) {/dvd}()

# Unmounting the device
$ umount /mounted/directory
```

Package manager: yum

```bash
# clean cahce
$ yum clean all

# Pre download and make usable of metadata enabled in the yum's repos
$ yum makecache

# List the enable repo in the machine
$ yum repolist

```

View all services status

```bash
# View all services status
$ systemctl list-unit-files
```

View network status

```bash
# 2 commons way
$ netstat -an
$ netstat -rn

# If `netstat command not found`
$ yum install net-tools
```

## Log of OS

Most of the logs stored in `/var/log`#

```bash
# Log of login
$ /var/etc/secure

$ /var/etc/dmesg
# All the global system messages located inside, including the messages that are logged during system startup
$ /var/etc/message
```

## Device performance monitoring

```bash
# With builtin ilb
$ top

# Using System Activity Reporter lib
$ yum add sysstat # if cannot find `sar`
# Where 1 is 1-minute and 5 is 5-times.
$ sar 1 5

# Monitor CPU Usage
# Option:
	# number : Keep monitoring every given second.
$ mpstat -P ALL {number}

```

## Backup file in Linux

```bash
# With tar
$ tar dvf[options] source dest
c create
v verbose
f file_name
x extarc
```

## Transfer file with rsync

```bash
# In the local machine
# Transfer file in the local machine
rsync -vzh /path/to/file /destination/directory/path/to/file

# Transfer directory in the local machine
rsync -avzh /directory/path /destination/directory/path

# Between 2 connected devices
# Transfer file between 2 machines
rsync -vzh /path/to/file root@192.168.56.101:/path/to/file
# Transfer directory between 2 machines
rsync -avzh /directory/path root@192.168.56.101:/root/path
```

```bash
# dd : Copy and convert

# backup entire harddisk
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb

# backup a partition
dd if=/dev/hda1 of=~/hdadisk.img

# creat an image of a harddisk
dd if=/dev/hda of=~/hdadisk.img

# restore using the harddisk image
dd if=hdadisk.img of=/dev/hdb
```

```bash
# View detailed of partitioned disk
$ fdisk -l
# Items in LVM
## PV: Physical volume
$ pvs
## VG: Volume group
$ vgs
$ vgdisplay
## LV: Logical volume
$ lvs
$ lvdisplay

# Create phisical volyme
$ pvcreate /dev/sdb

$ vgextend {volume group} /dev/sdb

# Allocate more size
$ lvextend -L1000M /dev/rhel/var
# Execute the allocation
$ xfs_growfs /dev/rhel/var

```
