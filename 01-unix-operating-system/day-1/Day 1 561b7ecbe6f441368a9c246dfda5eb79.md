# Day 1

# What I have learned today. (backfilled)

- Today start with very brief lecture covering the "what is Unix", "Linux Distribution"
- Then head straight to the technical content. Today covering the very basic command in Linux, `ls, cd, mkdir, rm, sudo`, which I omit in the note.
- The file system hierarchy, file manipulation, and file management.
- Recap on the permission,
  - learn more on user management, and finally understand the `chmod` command.
  - As well as group management, for assigning groups, and assigning `sudoer` group.
- The great things about today is about the credential files and directories in Unix.
  - I got to know where the credential of Unix's user are stored in the file system and how to use it.
- Also can turn machine off with simple command.

# OS: Unix

Permissive directories

## Group management

[Reference](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-managing_users_and_groups)

```
Group file location
/etc/group
	- <username>:<password:<group-id>:<group list>

Standard utilities for adding, modifying, and deleting groups
# groupadd <group name>
# groupdel <group name>
# groupmod

Assign a one or more group(s) to a user
# usermod -aG <group_name1>[,group_name2,...] <user_name>
```

## Credential directories

```
/etc/passwd
	- Store users' info such as uid and more
		- <username>:<(x)ecutable>:<user-id>:<group-id>:<comment>:<its home directory>:<default shell>

/etc/shadow
	- Store users' hashed credential
	- <username>:<hashed password>:<last pass change date>:<minimum pass age>:<maximum pass age>:<warning period>:<inactivity period>:<expire date>:<unused - reserved for future used>
```

## Turn VM off

```bash
# Turn the Unix machine off.
# NOTE!: Only able in root
init 0
```
